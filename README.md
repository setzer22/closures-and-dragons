# ui-test

Closures & Dragons (provisional name) is a virtual, online, D&D board written in clojure using. Instead of providing a web application like many popular alternatives, C&D is a client-server based desktop application. It's still in Alpha and has a long way to go, so no serious usage should be considered yet.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install all de dependencies with leiningen:

```
lein deps
```

## Usage

Launching a REPL should also launch the main GUI: 

```
lein repl
```

For now this is the only way to launch the program.
